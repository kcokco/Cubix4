Combine the dried chickpeas, baking soda, kosher salt, and cold water in a large bowl. Let them stand at room temperature overnight. When ready, drain and rinse thoroughly.\n2. Place the drained chickpeas in a Dutch oven. Add the baking soda, salt, onion, celery, carrot, garlic, bay leaves, and water.\n3. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce to a simmer with the cover cracked and cook until completely tender, about 2 hours. Add more water if necessary.\n\n#### Make the Tahini:\n1. Combine the garlic and lemon juice in a blender. Pulse until a pulpy puree is formed.\n2. Transfer to a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl. Press out as much liquid as possible with the back of a spoon, then discard the solids.\n3. Add the ground cumin and tahini paste to the liquid. Whisk to combine. The mixture will seize up and turn pasty. Add a few tablespoons of water, whisking between, until smooth and light (it should lose its shape if you let ribbons drop from the whisk into the bowl).\n4. Season to taste with salt.\n\n#### Finish the Hummus:\n1. Discard the onion, celery, and bay leaves from the chickpea mixture. Transfer everything else to a food processor with enough cooking liquid to cover them.\n2. Pulse slowly to mix, then increase speed to high until the texture is like a thick milkshake, about two minutes. You may need to remove the insert and cover with a towel to allow steam to escape.\n3. Transfer to a large bowl and whisk in the tahini sauce. Whisk in salt to taste.\n4. Let cool to room temperature (it should thicken to hold its shape). Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with za'atar and/or paprika before serving.\n\n### Cooking Time:\n- Prep Time: 15 minutes (plus overnight soaking)\n- Cooking Time: 2 hours\n\n### Servings:\n- Makes about 4-6 servings.\n\nEnjoy your homemade hummus! It's perfect for dipping or spreading. Let me know if you need anything else!"
